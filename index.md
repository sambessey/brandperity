Brandperity is the working title for a Google Chrome extension that allows you to personalise the Acme tenant to deliver a custom demo. It works by modifying text, images, and Material icons in the Acme UI, by applying substitutions locally in your browser.

## üêõ Known Bugs! üêõ

- [x] Switching between C360 databases will reset the view of attributes back to the default. Exit the C360 tab and re-enter it to reset this.
- [x] Values containing - or + (Both as the string you want to replace and the one you are replacing with)can cause problems like <undefined> to appear in the UI or substituions not to be made correctly. Currently no workaround, but I know why this happens. Please test carefully until fixed in the next release.
- [x] Any refreshes performed on Segment pages sometimes lead to the UI becoming stuck as it reloads. This only happens when refrehsing, and not when navigating normally as per a demo.
- [x] Clearing a list and importing a new, shorter one will cause the console.log to fill with errors in an infinite loop. (Does not impact the user experience). This is due to lazy coding and will be fixed in the next release.
- [x] Sometimes (and always on the first use after a fresh install) the 'save' button appears not to work/ your list will disappear or not look updated. Also the 'refresh' button seems to break at the same time. If this happens, refresh the page and open the extension again - your changes should all be reflected.
